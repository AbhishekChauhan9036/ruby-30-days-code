Today we're learning about running time! Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

## Task
A prime is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. Given a number, n, determine and print whether it's Prime or Not Prime.

Note: If possible, try to come up with a O(squareroot n) primality algorithm, or see what sort of optimizations you come up with for an O(n) algorithm. Be sure to check out the Editorial after submitting your code!

## Input Format

The first line contains an integer, T, the number of test cases.
Each of the T subsequent lines contains an integer, n, to be tested for primality.

## Output Format

For each test case, print whether n is Prime or Not Prime on a new line.

## Sample Input
