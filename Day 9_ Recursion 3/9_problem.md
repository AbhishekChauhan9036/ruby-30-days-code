## Objective
Today, we're learning and practicing an algorithmic concept called Recursion. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

## Task
Write a factorial function that takes a positive integer, N as a parameter and prints the result of N!(N factorial).

Note: If you fail to use recursion or fail to name your recursive function factorial or Factorial, you will get a score of 0.

## Input Format
A single integer, N (the argument to pass to factorial).



## Output Format
Print a single integer denoting N!.
Your submission must contain a recursive function named factorial.

## Sample Input
`3`

## Sample Output
`6`
