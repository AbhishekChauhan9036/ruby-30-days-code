## Objective
Today we're expanding our knowledge of Strings and combining it with what we've already learned about loops. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

## Task
Given a string, S , of length N that is indexed from 0 to N-1, print its even-indexed and odd-indexed characters as 2 space-separated strings on a single line (see the Sample below for more detail).

Note: 0 is considered to be an even index.

## Input Format

The first line contains an integer, T (the number of test cases).
Each line i of the T subsequent lines contain a String, S.

## Output Format

For each String S (where 0 <= j <= T-1), print S/j's even-indexed characters, followed by a space, followed by S/j's odd-indexed characters.
