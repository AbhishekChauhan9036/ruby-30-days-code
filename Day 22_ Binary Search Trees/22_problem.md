## Objective
Today, we're working with Binary Search Trees (BSTs). Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

## Task
The height of a binary search tree is the number of edges between the tree's root and its furthest leaf. You are given a pointer, *root*, pointing to the root of a binary search tree. Complete the getHeight function provided in your editor so that it returns the height of the binary search tree.

## Input Format

The locked stub code in your editor reads the following inputs and assembles them into a binary search tree:
The first line contains an integer, *n*, denoting the number of nodes in the tree.
Each of the *n* subsequent lines contains an integer, *data*, denoting the value of an element that must be added to the BST.

## Output Format

The locked stub code in your editor will print the integer returned by your getHeight function denoting the height of the BST.
