## Objective
Today we're working with Linked Lists. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

A Node class is provided for you in the editor. A Node object has an integer data field, *data*, and a Node instance pointer, *next*, pointing to another node (i.e.: the next node in a list).

A Node insert function is also declared in your editor. It has two parameters: a pointer, *head*, pointing to the first node of a linked list, and an integer *data* value that must be added to the end of the list as a new Node object.

## Task
Complete the insert function in your editor so that it creates a new Node (pass *data* as the Node constructor argument) and inserts it at the tail of the linked list referenced by the *head* parameter. Once the new node is added, return the reference to the *head* node.

Note: If the *head* argument passed to the insert function is null, then the initial list is empty.

## Input Format

The insert function has 2 parameters: a pointer to a Node named *head*, and an integer value, *data*.
The constructor for Node has 1 parameter: an integer value for the *data* field.

You do not need to read anything from stdin.

## Output Format

Your insert function should return a reference to the *head* node of the linked list.

## Sample Input

The following input is handled for you by the locked code in the editor:
The first line contains T, the number of test cases.
The *T* subsequent lines of test cases each contain an integer to be inserted at the list's tail.
```
4
2
3
4
1
```
## Sample Output

The locked code in your editor prints the ordered data values for each element in your list as a single line of space-separated integers:

`2 3 4 1`
